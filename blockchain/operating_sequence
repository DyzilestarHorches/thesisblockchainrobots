1. Setup blockchain
   2.1 Network initialize
   2.2 Deploy smart contract with correct RPC port
   2.3 Initialize tasks using correct smart contract address

2. Setup Robot Simulation
   1.1 Multirobot simulation
   1.2 Movement controller node
   1.3 Ros bridge
3. Start blockchain client-node interface

4. Check RQT_GRAPH: ros_webserver need to be connected to movement controller node with topics

Problems:

1. 2.4 the message sending start before the node connect to rosbridge
1. /taskAssign topic could be spammed, can use timestamp to prevent it (v)
1. How to Received message => add delay to while loop, problem was the while loop runs, (v)
1. Check the reporting to blockchain system (v)
1. Why it show transaction failed? Need debugging. status is not available => try catch (v)
1. Why the contract keep assigning to 1?
1. The interaction is good for now! <3
1. Build location system - firebase server with a storing system for offline working => firebase is only for changes of locations (v)
1. Stop smart contract from revertin stage
1. make sure the robot reuturn stage 1 only when it start the job successfully
1. summarize the system
1. Plan out what can be improved, and choose what to improve
1. Plan out the thesis
1. Propose to the teacher
1. robot navigation, and code processing
